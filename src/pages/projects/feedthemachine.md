### History:
I was listening to the podcast "Two Bears One Cave" while I was thinking of a project where I could try animating an SVG using classes I set up in FIGMA. Bert Kreisher ate something like 10 doughnuts in an hour. I thought it might be fun to try shoving some in his mouth as well.  

### Solutions:
I made use of the drag and drop API.
I had trouble finding a way to drag and drop how I wanted on both mobile and desktop without having to learn a large library. This works great on desktop but it is a little annoying on mobile.
