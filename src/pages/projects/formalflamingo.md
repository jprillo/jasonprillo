### History:

formalflamingo.com was one of the first domains I purchased when I began learning web development. It may be too long, weird, and came from a name generator of some kind but, it holds a place in my heart. There have been several generations of it. I will start with this particular project and show you its evolution at the end. 

Once I learn enough to code my own static HTML sites I started trying to make this website in 2017. There were a lot of versions that were never launched that look horrible but here are some of the ones I could find and have the code for. 

You have to start somewhere. I am writing this well after the fact and I cringe looking at the final product and it has only been a couple of years.  "Jason you are not still the guy who used all those weird css classes." 
I just needed to tell myself that. 

### Goals:
My goals were to take this website off a subscription shared hosting service and put it on something free. I also wanted to be able to push changes and use React which I had just started working at the time. I am redesigning and moving from static html pages so this is going to be a complete overhaul.

### Solutions:
Gastby.js: I chose gatsby on sitting inside on a mall on black friday waiting for my wife to get through the line in a candle store. I had already read about static site generators and Netlify and read the documentation while walking in the mall. I wonder if that is what the other people sitting around me were doing on thier phones too. It would have been good to have collaborated. 

### Roadblocks:
learning gatsby had a few hickups like anything else but it is straight forward and well documented. Gatsby images is powerful but also kind of a pain in the ass so beware. I never got it right in the blog of this project. 
learning Github and Netlify.
